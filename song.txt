Darlin', darlin'
Doesn't have a problem
Lyin' to herself
'Cause her liquor's top shelf
It's alarming, honestly
How charming she can be
Fooling everyone
Telling 'em she's having fun

She says, "You don't want to be like me
Don't wanna see all the things I've seen
I'm dyin', I'm dyin'"
She says, "You don't want to get this way
Famous and dumb at an early age
Lyin', I'm lyin"
